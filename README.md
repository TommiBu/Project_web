# Responsive Website Project

This project was created as part of an introductory HTML & CSS course I completed.  
It demonstrates the structure and styling of a **responsive website**, which adapts its layout and appearance depending on the device's screen size (e.g., desktop, tablet, mobile).

### Features:
- Semantic HTML5 structure
- Responsive design using CSS media queries
- Clean layout optimized for different screen resolutions
- Basic styling without JavaScript

The goal of the project was to practice fundamental front-end development skills and create a layout that works well across multiple devices.

Feel free to explore the code and try resizing your browser window to see the layout change.
